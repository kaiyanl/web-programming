					Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
					Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
					this exhibition features the first realization of a
					participatory environment Nauman conceived in 1970. The work
					is a narrow passageway that <span id="less1">wraps around an existing room,
					combining colored fluorescent light and closed-circuit video
					to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. An adjacent
					gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
					artist’s career.</span>

					Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries
					of art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
					beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
					studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman
					was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed
					process and activity over static, predetermined forms, and
					that took up language and the body as materials. Unbound by
					traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
					between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography,
					drawing, printmaking, and large-scale installation.

					This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
					co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and <span id="less2">the
					Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over twenty
					years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to
					survey the full breadth of Nauman's work, the present
					exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum focuses on a single,
					exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
					from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some
					forty corridors, rooms, and other architectural installations.
					The majority of these installations have been built for
					exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow
					Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on paper, in
					the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman originally
					developed the concept for this particular work in three
					drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first
					time that the installation has actually been realized.</span>
